  <p>
  1. I have played Cricket from a young age. My first acheivement being playing
  mens 1st XI at the age of 14 then 1st XI for Reeds School at age 15-18 where
  we enjoyed two league titles and I was lucky enough to hold the record for most
  wickets taken. I wasa part of the Surrey CCC academy, played semi-professionally
  for Sutton CC and Moari Oxshott CC. Finally I was preivileged to captain the
  University of Surrey CC for 3 years in which we won 4 titles and finished the
  highest position in the history of the club as well as starting the Womens cricket team.

    <li> Fitness and Nutrition </li>

  <p>
  With a BsC in Nutrition my interests lie in fitness and nutrition. Two things
  I believe are vital to living life healthily. I hvae 3 years experience as a
  fitness coach for TurnFit Studio in Guildford. Combining two of my hobbies is
  somthing I'm passionate about as I believe you can't have one without the other.

  <li>
    Cooking
  </li>

  <p>
  Cooking is a hobbie that has been worked on in the past two years as it is
  key to good nutrition. Cooking is a great social activity that I find is a great stress
  reliever and is satisfying when you produce a good meal. Plus who does'nt love food.
